# This image builds upon the React Native Community Android image:
# https://github.com/react-native-community/docker-android
#
# The base image is expected to remain relatively stable, and only
# needs to be updated when major dependencies such as the Android
# SDK or NDK are updated.
#
# In this Android Test image, we download the latest dependencies
# and build a Android application that can be used to run the
# tests specified in the scripts/ directory.
#

# For compliance reasons Microsoft cannot depend on docker hub.
# the reactnative community image is not published to MCR (https://mcr.microsoft.com/)
# If we need to run these validations we can clone the repo that publishes the community image
# Patch it to use mcr for the base ubuntu image, build the community image locally
# and then build this customized step on top of it.
#
# Disabling this is okay because per (Github#774) this test, which is redundant to Azure Devops test,
# fails in the fork because of Microsoft's V8 upgrade to Android
#
#FROM reactnativecommunity/react-native-android:7.0
