# Circle CI

React-Native-macOS performs CI on ADO and can be found in the `.ado` directory. This CircleCI is disabled for React-Native-macOS as it is not properly maintained and is repetitious from existing ADO CI. This only applies to the React-Native-macOS repo as Facebook's upstream repository still uses CircleCI to validate PRs.

This directory is home to the Circle CI configuration file. Circle is our continuous integration service provider. You can see the overall status of React Native's builds at https://circleci.com/gh/facebook/react-native

You may also see an individual PR's build status by scrolling down to the Checks section in the PR.
