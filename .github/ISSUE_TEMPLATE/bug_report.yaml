        How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn‚Äôt know you or your project?
        Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.
        Be specific! If the bug cannot be reproduced, your issue may be closed.

        Please share a project that reproduces the issue.
        There are three ways to do it:

        - See if the issue is already reproducable within the RNTester app.
          If the issue pertains to a particular Component or API, try the corresponding
          test page in RNTester. 

        - Create a new app using https://snack.expo.io/ and try to reproduce the issue in it.
          This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can‚Äôt share the real code.

        - Or, copy your app and remove things until you‚Äôre left with the minimal reproducible demo.
          This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a Snack.

        This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve
        Once you‚Äôre done, copy and paste the link to the Snack or a public GitHub repository below:

        Paste the link to an example project and exact instructions to reproduce the issue.
