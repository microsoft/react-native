            This issue is reported on an older version of React Native for macOS than is current, and is believed to be fixed in the latest version. Please try to update to the latest version and confirm if your issue still occurs.

            Per-version documentation is available [here](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/versions)

          reply: We use github to track issues exclusive to React Native for macOS. This issue seems to pertain to something outside of that scope. Please try asking over on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/macOS) as it is better suited for general macOS platform questions.
